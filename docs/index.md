# Market Competition Indicators

We define the **Herfindahlâ€“Hirschman Index (HHI)** as:

$$
HHI_{jt} = \sum_i (MarketShare_{ijt})^2
$$

Where:

- $MarketShare_{ijt}$ = revenue share of firm *i* in sector *j* at time *t*.
- The higher the $HHI$, the more concentrated the market.

---

The **adjusted version** accounts for trade balance:

$$
HHI_{adj} = \hat{\alpha}_{jt}^2 \times HHI_{jt}
$$

And the **Concentration Ratio (CR4)** is:

$$
CR4 = \sum_{k=1}^{4} s_k
$$

where $s_k$ represents the market share of the $k$-th largest firm.
